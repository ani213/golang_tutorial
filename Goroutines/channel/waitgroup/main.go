// 1. Synchronization Using sync.WaitGroup
// The sync.WaitGroup (wg) is used to make sure all goroutines complete before closing the channel.
// wg.Add(3) sets the counter to 3, as there are 3 goroutines sending data.
// Each sender goroutine calls wg.Done() once it sends a value, decrementing the counter.
// 2. Closing the Channel Safely
// A separate goroutine calls wg.Wait() to wait for all sender goroutines to finish.
// Only after all sender goroutines are done, it calls close(ch).
// This ensures the channel is never closed while it's still being written to, preventing a "send on closed channel" panic.
// 3. Using range to Receive from the Channel
// The for val := range ch loop reads values from ch until it's closed.
// Since the channel is properly closed, this loop terminates automatically after receiving all values.
// 4. Reading from a Closed Channel
// The final val, ok := <-ch statement attempts to read from ch after it has been closed.
// Since ch is closed:
// val returns 0 (default zero value of int).
// ok returns false, indicating the channel is closed.
