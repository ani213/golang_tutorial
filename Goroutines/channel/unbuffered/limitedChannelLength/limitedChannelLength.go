	ch <- "message2"

	fmt.Println("send goroutine unblocked...")

// receive1 receives messages from the channel.

	// It should be 1 because only one message fits in the buffer at a time.
	fmt.Printf("channel length: %v\n", len(ch))

	// Receive the first message from the channel, unblocking the 'send1' goroutine.
	fmt.Printf("received: %v\n", <-ch)

	// Receive the second message from the channel.
	// The second message was previously blocked, but now it is available.
	fmt.Printf("received: %v\n", <-ch)
}

// output -
// channel length: 0
// blocking send goroutine...
// channel length: 1
// received: message1
// received: message2
// send goroutine unblocked...

// or
// channel length: 0
// blocking send goroutine...
// channel length: 1
// send goroutine unblocked...
// received: message1
// received: message2

// Key Takeaways
// Buffered channels allow non-blocking sends up to their capacity.
// Sending beyond the capacity blocks the sender until a message is received.
// Receiving messages unblocks blocked send operations.
// Execution timing mattersâ€”goroutines execute asynchronously, so delays help demonstrate behavior.
