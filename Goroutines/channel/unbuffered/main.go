// An unbuffered channel means that sending to ch <- "message" will block until another goroutine reads from it.
// The send function attempts to send "message" into ch but gets blocked because no goroutine is ready to receive.
// Since the channel is unbuffered, its length is 0.
// The send goroutine remains blocked at ch <- "message".
// The receive function calls <-ch, reading "message" from the channel.
// This unblocks the send function, allowing it to proceed

// Key Takeaways
// Unbuffered channels block until a sender and receiver are both ready.
// The send goroutine gets blocked at ch <- "message" until receive reads the value.
// Once the receive goroutine reads from ch, the send goroutine unblocks and continues execution.
// Channel length (len(ch)) remains 0 because it's unbufferedâ€”values don't stay in it.
